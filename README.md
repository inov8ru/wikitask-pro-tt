### The problem

Wikipedia has millions of articles that need work, but no good way to match editors with tasks suited to their skills. Existing tools show generic maintenance lists. WikiTask Pro is different -- it studies *you* first, then recommends accordingly.

---

### How it works

```
Username  -->  Edit history analysis  -->  Deep profile  -->  Ranked tasks
                     |                        |                    |
              500+ recent edits        Skill mapping         Scored by
              Category analysis        Topic focus           relevance,
              Edit type breakdown      Activity patterns     impact &
              Page info lookup         Quality tier          feasibility
```

WikiTask Pro runs entirely in your browser. No accounts, no backend, no data stored.

### APIs

WikiTask Pro queries five public APIs -- all from the client, no keys required:

| Source | Data |
|:---|:---|
| MediaWiki Action API | Edit history, page metadata, categories, templates |
| Wikimedia Pageviews | Article traffic, trending pages |
| Semantic Scholar | Academic paper discovery |
| CrossRef | DOI and citation metadata |
| PubMed | Biomedical literature |

---

### Task scoring

Every task is scored across four dimensions:

```
Relevance   ████████░░  How well the task matches your topic expertise
Impact      ██████████  Article pageviews, importance, visibility
Feasibility ███████░░░  Estimated effort based on your skill profile
Urgency     █████░░░░░  Staleness, trending status, degradation signals
```

Tasks are ranked by a weighted composite. Filters let you narrow by topic, type, or difficulty.
